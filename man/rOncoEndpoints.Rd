\usage{
rOncoEndpoints(
  nsim,
  group = NULL,
  n,
  p = NULL,
  hazard_OS = NULL,
  hazard_PFS = NULL,
  rho_tte_resp = NULL,
  copula = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{nsim}{Integer. The number of simulations to perform. Must be a
positive integer.}

\item{group}{Character vector. Names of the treatment groups. If NULL
(default), groups will be named "Group1", "Group2", etc. Length must
match the lengths of other vector parameters.}

\item{n}{Integer vector. Sample sizes for each group. All elements must be
positive integers. Length must match the number of groups.}

\item{p}{Numeric vector or NULL. Marginal probabilities of objective
response for each group. If NULL, no Response endpoint is generated. When
provided, all elements must be between 0 and 1 (exclusive). Length must
match the number of groups. Default is NULL.}

\item{hazard_OS}{Numeric vector or NULL. Hazard rates for OS for each group.
If NULL, no OS endpoint is generated. When provided, all elements must be
positive. Length must match the number of groups. Default is NULL.}

\item{hazard_PFS}{Numeric vector or NULL. Hazard rates for PFS for each group.
If NULL, no PFS endpoint is generated. When provided, all elements must
be positive. If both hazard_OS and hazard_PFS are provided, hazard_PFS
must be strictly greater than hazard_OS to ensure PFS <= OS. Length must
match the number of groups. Default is NULL.}

\item{rho_tte_resp}{Numeric vector or NULL. Desired correlation coefficients
between a time-to-event endpoint and Response. Required when both a TTE
endpoint (OS or PFS) and p are provided. All elements must be
within the feasible range determined by Fréchet-Hoeffding bounds (which
depend only on p, not on hazard rates). Length must match the number of
groups. Default is NULL.}

\item{copula}{Character or NULL. The copula family to use for modeling the
dependence between TTE and Response. Options are "Clayton" or "Frank".
Required when p and at least one TTE endpoint are provided (defaults to
"Clayton" if not specified). Default is NULL.}
}
\value{
A data frame with nsim * sum(n) rows and columns depending on the
configuration:
\itemize{
\item OS only: simID, Group, OS
\item PFS only: simID, Group, PFS
\item Response only: simID, Group, Response
\item OS + Response: simID, Group, OS, Response
\item PFS + Response: simID, Group, PFS, Response
\item OS + PFS: simID, Group, OS, PFS
\item OS + PFS + Response: simID, Group, OS, PFS, Response
}
}
\description{
A unified function that generates random samples of oncology endpoints with
flexible configurations. This function supports seven different patterns:
\enumerate{
\item OS only
\item PFS only
\item Response only
\item OS + Response (correlated)
\item PFS + Response (correlated)
\item OS + PFS (correlated, with PFS <= OS constraint)
\item OS + PFS + Response (all correlated, with PFS <= OS constraint)
}

This function is designed specifically for oncology clinical trial simulations,
particularly for generating objective response (Response), progression-free
survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS) data with appropriate correlation
structure.
}
\details{
This function provides seven modes of operation based on which parameters are
provided:

\strong{Single endpoint modes:}
\itemize{
\item OS only (hazard_OS provided)
\item PFS only (hazard_PFS provided)
\item Response only (p provided)
}

\strong{Two endpoint modes:}
\itemize{
\item OS + Response (hazard_OS + p): Correlated via copula specified
by rho_tte_resp. The copula parameter is determined solely by p and
rho_tte_resp, independent of hazard_OS.
\item PFS + Response (hazard_PFS + p): Correlated via copula specified
by rho_tte_resp. The copula parameter is determined solely by p and
rho_tte_resp, independent of hazard_PFS.
\item OS + PFS (hazard_OS + hazard_PFS): Correlated using the Fleischer model,
ensuring PFS <= OS. The correlation is directly determined by the hazard
ratio: Corr(OS, PFS) = hazard_OS / hazard_PFS.
}

\strong{Three endpoint mode:}
\itemize{
\item OS + PFS + Response (all three provided): The PFS <= OS constraint is
maintained using the Fleischer model. The Response endpoint is correlated
with OS (not PFS) via the copula specified by rho_tte_resp. The copula
parameter depends only on p and rho_tte_resp.
}
}
\note{
\strong{CRITICAL: Correlation structure in three-endpoint mode (OS + PFS + Response):}
\itemize{
\item Response is correlated with OS via rho_tte_resp (user-specified)
\item Response is NOT directly correlated with PFS
\item The correlation between PFS and Response emerges automatically from
the model structure and is NOT user-specified
\item To predict the resulting PFS-Response correlation, use
\code{\link{CorResponsePFS}} with your specified parameters
\item This design reflects the biological assumption that response and
survival are linked through the underlying disease process
}

\strong{Important implementation details:}
\itemize{
\item The correlation between a binary Response endpoint and an exponentially
distributed TTE endpoint depends only on the response probability (p) and
the copula parameter, not on the TTE hazard rate. This is a key theoretical
property that simplifies the correlation structure.
\item The feasible range of correlations between Response and TTE endpoints
is determined by Fréchet-Hoeffding bounds, which depend only on p.
\item For the OS-PFS relationship (Fleischer model), the correlation is
directly determined by the ratio of hazard rates.
}

\strong{Copula selection:}
The function uses copula-based methods to model dependencies:
\itemize{
\item Clayton copula: Suitable for lower tail dependence (strong correlation
at low values). Cannot model negative dependence.
\item Frank copula: Flexible for both positive and negative dependence with
symmetric tail behavior.
