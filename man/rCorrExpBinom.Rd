\value{
A tibble with the following columns:
\describe{
\item{hazard}{True hazard rate (= log(2) / median survival time).}
\item{MST}{True median survival time.}
\item{p}{True probability of responder.}
\item{rho}{True correlation between two outcomes.}
\item{UL.rho}{Upper bound of the correlation.}
\item{n}{Sample size.}
\item{copula.fun}{Specified copula function.}
\item{theta}{Estimated association parameter.}
\item{simdata}{Simulated dataset including correlated time-to-event and binary outcomes.}

\item{hat.rho}{Estimated correlation between two outcomes for simulated dataset.}
}
}
\description{
This function generates pseudorandom numbers of correlated time-to-event and binary outcomes
using copula-based approaches. It allows researchers to simulate datasets with specified
correlation structures between survival times and binary response variables.
}
\details{
Since correlation of paired time-to-event and binary outcomes is not free to range over \link{-1, 1},
the boundary of correlation can be calculated by Frechet-Hoeffding bounds.
This function currently only covers positive correlation cases.
}
\note{
The current implementation supports only Clayton and Frank copulas.

\examples{
\dontrun{
# Generate 1000 observations with median survival time of 12 months,
# response probability of 0.2, and correlation of 0.5 using Clayton copula
sim_data <- rCorrExpBinom(hazard = log(2) / 12, p = 0.2, rho = 0.5, 
                          n = 1000, copula.fun = 'Clayton')

# Access the simulated dataset
head(sim_data$simdata[[1]])

# View summary statistics
