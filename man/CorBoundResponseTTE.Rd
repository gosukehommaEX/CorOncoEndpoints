\title{Compute Correlation Bounds Between Response and Time-to-Event Endpoints}
\usage{
CorBoundResponseTTE(p)
}
\arguments{
\item{p}{Numeric. The true probability of the binary response endpoint.
Must be between 0 and 1 (exclusive).}
}
\value{
A numeric vector of length 2 containing:
\itemize{
\item First element: Lower bound (maximum negative dependence)
\item Second element: Upper bound (maximum positive dependence)
}
}
\description{
Computes the lower and upper bounds of the correlation coefficient between
a binary response endpoint and a time-to-event (TTE) endpoint. These bounds
are derived using Fréchet-Hoeffding copula bounds and depend only on the
response probability, not on the hazard rate of the TTE endpoint.
}
\details{
The Fréchet-Hoeffding bounds provide theoretical limits for the correlation
between a binary response endpoint (e.g., objective response) and an
exponentially distributed TTE endpoint (e.g., overall survival or
progression-free survival).

The correlation bounds are given by:
\deqn{\log(1-p)\sqrt{\frac{1-p}{p}} \leq \text{Corr}(TTE, Response) \leq \log\left(\frac{1}{p}\right)\sqrt{\frac{p}{1-p}}}

Key properties:
\itemize{
\item The bounds depend only on \code{p}, not on the TTE hazard rate
\item Lower bound: achieved by countermonotonic copula \eqn{C(u,v) = \max\{u+v-1, 0\}}
\item Upper bound: achieved by comonotonic copula \eqn{C(u,v) = \min\{u, v\}}
\item The bounds are symmetric: if \code{p} is replaced by \code{1-p},
the lower and upper bounds swap with negated signs
\item Maximum absolute bound value of approximately 0.805 occurs at
\code{p ≈ 0.203} (for upper bound) and \code{p ≈ 0.797} (for lower bound).
This is a fundamental property of the Fréchet-Hoeffding bounds for
correlations between binary and continuous exponential variables.
}
}
\note{
The independence of correlation bounds from the hazard rate is an
interesting theoretical result. While the hazard rate determines the scale
of the TTE endpoint, it does not affect the range of achievable correlations
with the binary response endpoint. This occurs because the hazard rate only
affects the scaling of the TTE variable, while the binary response endpoint
is determined solely by the probability \code{p}.

\examples{
# Calculate bounds with response probability = 0.4
CorBoundResponseTTE(p = 0.4)

# Example with higher response rate
CorBoundResponseTTE(p = 0.6)

# Example with lower response rate
CorBoundResponseTTE(p = 0.2)

# Example with intermediate values
bounds <- CorBoundResponseTTE(p = 0.35)
cat("Lower bound:", bounds[1], "\nUpper bound:", bounds[2], "\n")

# Demonstrating the effect of response probability on bounds
# The bounds are widest around p ≈ 0.203 and p ≈ 0.797
CorBoundResponseTTE(p = 0.203)
CorBoundResponseTTE(p = 0.5)
CorBoundResponseTTE(p = 0.797)

# Demonstrating symmetry property
CorBoundResponseTTE(p = 0.3)
-rev(CorBoundResponseTTE(p = 0.7))  # Should be nearly identical

# Find maximum absolute bound
p_seq <- seq(0.01, 0.99, by = 0.001)
bounds_upper <- sapply(p_seq, function(p) CorBoundResponseTTE(p)[2])
max_bound_idx <- which.max(bounds_upper)
cat("Maximum upper bound:", round(bounds_upper[max_bound_idx], 4),
    "at p =", round(p_seq[max_bound_idx], 3), "\n")
