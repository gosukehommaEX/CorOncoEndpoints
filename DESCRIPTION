Description: Provides functions to generate correlated oncology endpoints including
    overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), and objective response
    using copula-based approaches. This package supports flexible configurations
    for clinical trial simulations with appropriate correlation structures and
    constraints (e.g., PFS <= OS).
